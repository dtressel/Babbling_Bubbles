      <h2>Strategies and Tips</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Use Letters Wisely
          <ul>
            <li>With an ever-changing board, it's easy to end up with a bad board with mostly vowels or only unusual letters.</li>
            <li>If you find yourself with bad letter arrangements, use letters strategically to use up unfortunate letter placements before the board becomes wordless!</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Save Multiplier Bubbles
          <ul>
            <li>While it may be tempting to use multiplier bubbles right away it's often best to save them until you can use several multiplier bubbles for a single word because of compounding.</li>
            <li>You may also want to save multiplier bubbles to use with unusual letters with high letter scores or until you can create a longer word with a nice word length bonus.</li>
            <li>Using multiplier bubbles effectively can result in single word scores in the thousands!!</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Don't play too quickly!
          <ul>
            <li>Unlike other similar word finding games, entering words as soon as you find them is usually not the best way to play Babbling Bubbles!</li>
            <li>Take a scan of the board, find any multiplier bubbles, look for parts of the board with good and bad letter arrangements, and plan how you can strategically enter words and pop bubbles to create that perfect scenario to get that monster word score!</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
