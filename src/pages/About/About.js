      <h2>About Babbling Bubbles</h2>
      <p>Babbling Bubbles was created by Daniel Tressel, a software engineer living in Michigan. Daniel has always loved word games, especially Boggle and Scrabble. When thinking about how to combine the gameplay of both games, Daniel came up with Babbling Bubbles! Babbling Bubbles combines the word finding skills of Boggle with the creative use of letters to create high scores of Scrabble. With an ever-changing grid, new interesting strategies arise that eclipse the strategies of either game.</p>
      <p>Daniel only recently started his journey into software engineering in the summer of 2022. After spending 15 years working as a classical cellist and classical composer, he decided he needed a change and attended Springboard's Software Engineering bootcamp. Babbling Bubbles was born as his 2nd "capstone" project for Springboard.</p>
      <p>In addition to music and programming, Daniel loves to play chess and fish. He is currently looking for work as a software engineer. Please get in touch if you have an interesting opportunity for him! Feel free to email him at dtresseldev@gmail.com and see his social links at the bottom of the page.</p>
      <p>Thanks for playing Babbling Bubbles! If you enjoy the game, please spread the word! Let's create a great community of Babblers!</p>
